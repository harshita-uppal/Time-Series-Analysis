This project predicts stock prices based on historical data using time series analysis. The model is developed with ARIMA, and preprocessing includes checking stationarity and removing seasonal trends.

- Data Preparation: Uses Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- Statistical Analysis: Employs Statsmodels to check stationarity and remove seasonality.
- Modeling and Prediction: Uses ARIMA for predictions and Scikit-learn for evaluating forecast accuracy.
